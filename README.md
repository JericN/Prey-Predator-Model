# 🐾 PreyPredatorModel – Ecosystem Simulation App

**PreyPredatorModel** is a Java desktop application that simulates the interactions between predators, prey, and grass within a closed ecosystem. Developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), this app provides a visual and interactive way to explore the delicate balance of a food chain.

In this simulation:
- 🌿 **Grass** grows over time and is consumed by **prey** (e.g., rabbits).
- 🐇 **Prey** must eat grass to survive and reproduce.
- 🐺 **Predators** hunt prey for survival.

As the simulation runs, users can observe how population changes affect the overall ecosystem — highlighting cycles of growth, scarcity, and collapse. It's a fun and educational tool for understanding ecological dynamics and system modeling.
